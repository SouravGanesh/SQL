The following is a simplified explanation of the SQL execution order:

- 𝐅𝐑𝐎𝐌/𝐉𝐎𝐈𝐍: The FROM clause specifies the tables from which the data will be retrieved. The JOIN clause can be used to combine data from multiple tables.
- 𝐖𝐇𝐄𝐑𝐄: The WHERE clause is used to filter the data based on specific conditions.
- 𝐆𝐑𝐎𝐔𝐏 𝐁𝐘: The GROUP BY clause is used to group the data based on one or more columns.
- 𝐇𝐀𝐕𝐈𝐍𝐆: The HAVING clause is used to filter the grouped data based on specific conditions.
- 𝐒𝐄𝐋𝐄𝐂𝐓: The SELECT clause specifies the columns that will be returned in the result set.
- 𝐃𝐈𝐒𝐓𝐈𝐍𝐂𝐓: The DISTINCT keyword can be used to ensure that only distinct rows are returned in the result set.
- 𝐎𝐑𝐃𝐄𝐑 𝐁𝐘: The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set in ascending or descending order.
- 𝐋𝐈𝐌𝐈𝐓: The LIMIT clause can be used to restrict the number of rows returned.
