# 1211. Queries Quality and Percentage

## Problem Description
https://leetcode.com/problems/queries-quality-and-percentage/
###
We define query quality as:

The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.

We also define poor query percentage as:

The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

Write a solution to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.

Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

## Solution 1:
### T-SQL
```
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
select query_name, ROUND(SUM(rating*1.0/position)/count(*),2) as quality, 
round((sum(case when rating <3 then 1.00 else 0 end)/ count(rating))*100,2) as poor_query_percentage
from Queries
where query_name is not null
group by query_name
```
