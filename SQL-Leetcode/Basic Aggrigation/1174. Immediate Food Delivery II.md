# 1174. Immediate Food Delivery II

## Problem Description
https://leetcode.com/problems/immediate-food-delivery-ii/
###
If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.

The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.

Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.

## Solution 1:
### T-SQL
```
WITH MinOrderDates AS (
    SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date) AS min_order_date
    FROM Delivery
    GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT ROUND(CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS FLOAT)*100 / COUNT(*), 2) as immediate_percentage
FROM Delivery d
INNER JOIN MinOrderDates m ON d.customer_id = m.customer_id AND d.order_date = m.min_order_date;

```
